# C#.NET SQL Project

This project is built using C#.NET and SQL for managing data. The project utilizes a variety of libraries for handling UI, data access, cryptography, and more. The source code is hosted on GitHub, and this README file will guide you through setting up and running the project.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET Framework**
- **SQL Server**
- **Windows Forms**

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Open your terminal and clone the project repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**  
   - Open the `.sln` file in [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
   
3. **Install required NuGet packages**  
   Ensure that all the necessary NuGet packages are restored. Visual Studio should automatically restore them. If not, go to **Tools** > **NuGet Package Manager** > **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution** and install the missing packages.

4. **Configure the database**  
   Make sure you have SQL Server installed. The project uses SQL Server for data storage. See the [Database Setup](#database-setup) section for more details on configuring your database.

5. **Run the project**  
   Press `F5` to build and run the project in Visual Studio.

## Dependencies

The following libraries and frameworks are used in the project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.ComponentModel;
using System.Data;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;
```

### Key Dependencies:

- **System.Data.SqlClient**: To interact with SQL Server.
- **System.Windows.Forms**: To build the Windows-based graphical user interface (GUI).
- **System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates**: To handle cryptographic operations such as X.509 certificates.
- **System.ComponentModel**: For component-level operations and data binding.
- **System.Linq**: For querying collections and data.

These dependencies are included in the .NET Framework, but make sure you have .NET Framework installed on your system. You can install it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

## Database Setup

This project uses SQL Server to manage and store data. To set up the database:

1. Install **SQL Server** if you don't have it already. You can download it from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).

2. Create a database in SQL Server:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or any SQL client.
   - Run the SQL script provided in the `/database` folder of this project (if available) to create the required tables and data.

3. Update the connection string in the `App.config` file (or relevant config file) with your SQL Server credentials:

   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
     <add name="DefaultConnection" 
          connectionString="Data Source=YourServer;Initial Catalog=YourDatabase;Integrated Security=True" 
          providerName="System.Data.SqlClient"/>
   </connectionStrings>
   ```

4. After configuring the connection, you can start interacting with the database when running the project.

## Usage

1. After setting up the environment and running the project, you will see the Windows Forms UI.
2. Use the available buttons and input fields to interact with the application.
3. Data operations such as adding, updating, and deleting entries are done via SQL interactions within the application.
